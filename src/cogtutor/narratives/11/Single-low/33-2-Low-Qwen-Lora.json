To find the equation of the line, we first need to find the slope.\nUsing the formula for slope, we have $\\frac{17-5}{8-4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3$.\nSo the equation of the line is $y"

Then, I take a step back, take a few deep breaths to calm down, and remind myself that mistakes are part of the learning process. Sometimes, I also find it helpful to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts, which helps me regain focus and confidence. \n\nIt's important to remember that managing emotions isn't about completely suppressing them, but rather understanding them and using strategies to channel them in a productive way."

Regular checks could have helped identify this error earlier.\n\n2. **Encourages Better Understanding**: Assessing the strategy at each step encourages deeper understanding of the problem. Instead of simply moving forward, the student would have to think critically about each step and determine if it makes sense in relation to the problem.\n\n3. **Promotes Adaptability**: It promotes adaptability.
