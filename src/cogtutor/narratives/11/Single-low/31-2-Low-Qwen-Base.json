One successful case I can think of is the application of the \"divide and conquer\" strategy in tackling complex programming challenges. \n\nFor instance, if I encounter a challenging programming problem that requires me to implement a complex algorithm, I can break it down into smaller sub-problems using the divide and conquer approach. By solving each sub-problem individually, I can eventually piece together the solution to the original problem. This strategy helps simplify the problem and make it more manageable.\n\nAnother example is applying mathematical induction to solve complex mathematical proofs. By breaking the proof into base cases and inductive steps, I can systematically tackle the problem and reach a solution. This strategy allows me to approach complex problems step-by-step and build on my understanding incrementally.\n\nOverall, strategy transfer is a valuable tool in problem-solving, as it enables me to adapt existing strategies and techniques to new situations and challenges.
