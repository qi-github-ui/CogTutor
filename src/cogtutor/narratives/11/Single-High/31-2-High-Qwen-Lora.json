We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, which can be expressed by the formula P = 2(length + width). Given that the perimeter is 28 inches, we can write this as 28 = 2(length + width). We also know that the length is twice the width, so we can write the length as 2w, where w is the width. Substituting this into our perimeter equation, we get 28 = 2(2w + w). Simplifying this, we find 28 = 2(3w), which leads to 14 = 3w. Solving for w, we find that w = 14/3 inches. Since the length is twice the width, the length is 2(14"

By utilizing similar strategies from previously learned problems, I can more easily identify the most effective approach to tackle new challenges. This saves time and effort because I don't have to start from scratch each time. For example, if I've previously used a specific method to solve a similar problem, I can apply that same method to a new problem without needing to think about all the steps again.
