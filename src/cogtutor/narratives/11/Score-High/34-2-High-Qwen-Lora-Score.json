                "response": "During the problem-solving process, I enhance my confidence by carefully analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. I focus on understanding the key requirements and constraints, and then plan out a step-by-step approach to solving it. This methodical approach helps me feel more in control of the situation, reduces anxiety, and allows me to tackle the problem systematically. Additionally, I try to visualize the solution, which helps me better understand the relationships between different elements and the logic behind each step. By breaking down the problem and visualizing the solution, I feel more confident in my ability to find the correct answer. This method has been quite helpful in my problem-solving process, as it allows me to approach complex problems in a structured and organized way.",

                "response": "Based on the transcript, here are the main points I gathered:\n\n1. You initially struggled with the first problem because you weren't confident in your understanding of the decimal concept. You thought 0.893 was too small and needed reassurance from others. This indicates that confidence can sometimes lead to underestimating the problem's difficulty or not knowing the correct approach.\n\n2. For the second problem, you recognized the importance of being systematic, even if it means taking time to approach the task differently. Initially, you tried to find the correct answer intuitively, but it didn't work. This shows that sometimes, confidence can cloud judgment, and it's better to reassess and take a structured approach.\n\n3. The third problem required you to analyze data and draw conclusions. You felt a bit overwhelmed, but your confident approach helped you find the solution by systematically eliminating possibilities. This exemplifies how confidence can help guide logical reasoning and problem decomposition in complex scenarios.\n\n4. You learned that confidence",

                "response": "If I feel anxious or nervous about solving a problem, I try various methods to alleviate those feelings. Here are some of the strategies I use:\n\n1. Take a deep breath: I try to slow down my breathing and take a couple of deep breaths to calm myself down. This helps me focus on thinking logically rather than getting overwhelmed by my emotions.\n\n2. Break the problem into smaller parts: I like to try and divide the problem into smaller, more manageable sections. This helps me see it less as an all-encompassing task and more as a series of steps that I can tackle individually.\n\n3. Positive self-talk: I try to encourage myself by repeating positive affirmations, reminding myself that I am capable of solving this problem. This helps boost my confidence and shifts my mindset from negative to positive.\n\n4. Ask for help: If I am still struggling, I don't hesitate to ask my teacher or a peer for guidance. Sometimes, an outside perspective can help me see the problem",

Reflect on the problem: I would first think about what the problem was asking, and remind myself of the steps I took to solve it. This helps me understand how I approached the problem and what strategies worked well.\n\n2. Analyze my steps: I would go through each step of my solution to see if there were any logical leaps or errors. If I made any mistakes, I would re-evaluate those steps to learn from them and avoid similar errors in the future.\n\n3. Reflect on my thought process: I would think about the thought process that guided my decisions. Were there any moments where I had doubts? How did I overcome those doubts? Understanding my own thought process helps me recognize patterns in my problem-solving style.\n\n4. Identify my strengths: In the process of solving the problem, I would identify the skills and strategies that I",
