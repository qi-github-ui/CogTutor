Now, you need to solve a math problem. Please describe your thought process and steps in detail according to your ability level. The math problem is: Problem Background\\nIn this activity, a number line will be displayed on the screen, and students need to determine the position of a specific value by estimating and comparing numbers.\\n\\nProblem Details\\nTask 1: Find the position of 0.6\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nLook at the number 0.6 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\n0.6 is very close to 0.5, which is the middle of the number line.\\nHow would you estimate the position of 0.6 starting from 0.5? Should you move left or right? How much should you move?\\nThe way to find 0.6 is to first reach 0.5, which is the middle of the number line, and then move one-tenth of a mark to the right to reach 0.6!\\nTask 2: Find the position of 0.03\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nLook at the number 0.03 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\nLet's try estimating the position of 0.03 by first finding 0.0! Locate 0.0 on the left end of the number line. Do you know if 0.03 is to the left or right of 0.0?\\nIf this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.03 is closer to: 0, 0.1, or the middle at 0.05?\\nAlmost there! This number is hidden to the right of 0.0. Move less than half a mark to the right to reach 0.03.\\nTask 3: Determine the larger number (operation corresponding to \\\"larger\\\")\\n\\nProblem\\nNumber line range: From 0.0 to 1.0.\\nTask: On the number line, you have found the values 0.08 and 0.018.\\nQuestion: Which value is larger? Please fill in the correct answer.\\n\\nPlease fill in the larger value between 0.08 and 0.018: _______.\\n\\nHints\\n\\nWhich of the two numbers you placed on the number line is larger?\\nYou just need to remember whether the larger number is placed on the right or left, but the number line will give you hints; where is 0? Where is 1?\\n1 is larger and is on the right. The number placed on the right is larger.\\nFeedback Mechanism\\nCorrect Operation: The screen will display a green \\\"Correct!\\\"\\nIncorrect Operation: The screen will display a red \\\"Incorrect, try another value.\\\"\\nAnswers:\\nTask 1 (Find the position of 0.6): The correct answer range is from 0.582 to 0.618.\\nTask 2 (Find the position of 0.03): The correct answer range is from 0.012 to 0.048.\\n\\nThis problem design aims to enhance students' understanding of the relative size of numbers through number line and number comparison activities, and to deepen their understanding of the relative size relationships between numbers through intuitive interaction..Ability level classification criteria:\\nLow-level students typically understand math problems"
