Since 0.093 has no tenths, I note that it is between the tenths 0.0 and 0.1. I begin by identifying the hundredths and thousandths in 0.093; it has 9 hundredths and 3 thousandths. I can conclude that 0.093 is slightly further than the tick mark for 0.09, indicating I need to subdivide the space between 0.09 and 0.1. Furthermore, I visualize there being ten sections between these two tick marks, which provides me with exact placement.

My next steps involve counting the individual sections between 0.09 and 0.1 to see where 0.093 would fit in.
