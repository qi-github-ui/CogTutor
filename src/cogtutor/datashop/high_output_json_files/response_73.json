The math problem is: Problem Background\\nIn this activity, a number line will be displayed on the screen, and students need to determine the position of a specific value by estimating and comparing numbers.\\n\\nProblem Details\\nTask 1: Find the position of 0.15\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nLook at the number 0.15 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\nIf this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.15 is closer to: 0.1, 0.2, or the middle at 0.15?\\nLet's try estimating the position of 0.15 by first finding 0.1! Start from the left end of the number line at 0.0. 0.1 should be one-tenth of a mark to the right of 0.0. Do you know if 0.15 is to the left or right of 0.1?\\nFinding 0.1 is better than finding 0.2 because finding 0.2 is more complicated. This number is hidden to the right of 0.1. Move half a mark to the right to reach the position of 0.15.\\nTask 2: Find the position of 0.643\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nLook at the number 0.643 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\nIf this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.643 is closer to: 0.6, 0.7, or the middle at 0.65?\\nLet's try estimating the position of 0.643 by first finding 0.6! Start from the middle of the number line at 0.5. 0.6 should be one-tenth of a mark to the right of 0.5. Do you know if 0.643 is to the left or right of 0.6?\\nFinding 0.6 is better than finding 0.7 because finding 0.7 is more complicated. This number is hidden to the right of 0.6. Move half a mark to the right to reach the position of 0.643.\\nTask 3: Determine the larger number (operation corresponding to \\\"larger\\\")\\n\\nProblem\\nNumber line range: From 0.0 to 1.0.\\nTask: On the number line, you have found the values 0.15 and 0.643.\\nQuestion: Which value is larger? Please fill in the correct answer.\\n\\nPlease fill in the larger value between 0.15 and 0.643: _______.\\n\\nHints\\n\\nWhich of the two numbers you placed on the number line is larger?\\nYou just need to remember whether the larger number is placed on the right or left, but the number line will give you hints; where is 0? Where is 1?\\nFeedback Mechanism\\nCorrect Operation: The screen will display a green \\\"Correct!\\\"\\nIncorrect Operation: The screen will display a red \\\"Incorrect, try another value.\\\"\\nAnswers:\\nFor Task 1: Find the position of 0.15, the correct answer range is from 0.133 to 0.167.\\nFor Task 2: Find the position of 0.643, the correct answer range is from 0.625 to 0.661.\\n\\nThis problem design aims to enhance students' understanding of the relative size of numbers through number line and number comparison activities, and to deepen their understanding of the relative size relationships between numbers through intuitive interaction..

To be precise, I suggest splitting the range into smaller sections, perhaps into increments of 0.05 or 0.1, which helps me accurately pinpoint the position of 0.15.
