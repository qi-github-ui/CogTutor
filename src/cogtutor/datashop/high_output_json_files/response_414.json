For Task 1, I need to locate 0.097. This number is between 0.0 and 0.1, so I think about where it might fall compared to 0.1 and 0. This involves estimating visually and making a point of reference by possibly dividing the line into tenths or quarters. I recognize that 0.097 is closer to 0.1 than to 0.0. Next, I reason that it does not reach 0.1 entirely, so I move slightly leftward from 0.1 to pinpoint 0.097. \\n\\nFor Task 2, I evaluate 0.9, which I know is very close to 1.0. I identify that moving left from 1.0 by one-tenth should lead me to the location of 0.9.
