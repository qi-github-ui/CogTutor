The first step is to identify the tenths, which are represented on the number line as tick marks. Since 0.093 has 0 tenths, I know it's closer to 0.0. Next, I check the number of hundredths in 0.093, which gives me 9 hundredths, meaning I need to move slightly past the 0.09 mark. I visualize the number line and note that there are ten small divisions between 0.09 and 0.1 (which represent the thousandths).
