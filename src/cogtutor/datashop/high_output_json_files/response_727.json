I assumed that the number line is linear and that numbers to the right are always larger than those to the left. For instance, when estimating the position of 0.6, I predicted it would be just a small move to the right of 0.5 since it is closer to that midpoint than to 1. This guided my decision to first locate 0.5 and then make a precise estimated move. Similarly, for 0.03, I started from 0.0 and anticipated that I would only need to shift slightly right, given how small 0.03 is compared to 0.1. Thus, my next steps were based on closely estimating those small increments along the number line.\" },\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"}\n    ]\n}"
