For Task 1, I need to find the position of 0.15. I know that 0.15 is greater than 0.0 and less than 0.5. I can split the number line into quarters: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Since 0.15 is closer to 0.0 than to 0.25, I will place it slightly to the right of 0.0. The precise range I aim for is between 0.133 and 0.167.\\n\\nFor Task 2, I will estimate the position of 0.643. It is between 0.6 and 0.7. Since 0.643 is closer to 0.6, I can start from 0.5 and identify where 0.6 is, then move slightly to the right, stopping at approximately 0.643, which falls within 0.625 to 0.661 range.\\n\\nFor Task 3, I know I need to compare 0.15 and 0.643.
