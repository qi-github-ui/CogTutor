I also revisited the hints provided about the arrangement of tenths and hundredths. This review allowed me to see the correct positions of 0.349 and 0.893 more accurately. Additionally, I considered drawing out the number line to physically see the positions, which helped reinforce my understanding and confidence in my final answers.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
