I estimated that 0.349 is a bit closer to 0.3 than 0.4, so I focused on how to find 0.3 first. I then realized that I can find 0.333 as a third of the number line, and after that, I can see that 0.349 is slightly to the right of that number. I decided that moving to the right would get me closer to 0.349, which I estimated to be around 0.34.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"While solving this problem, what assumptions or predictions are you making?
