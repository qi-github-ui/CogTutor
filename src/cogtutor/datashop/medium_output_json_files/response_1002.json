I recognize that it has 0 tenths, which means I'm looking between 0.0 and 0.1. I begin by counting one large section from 0.0 to 0.1. Since I'm specifically looking for 0.093, I identify it as being between the 0.09 and 0.1 marks.\\n\\nNext, I note that there are 9 hundredths, which means I should look closely after the tick mark for 0.09. Each hundredth further divides into ten smaller ticks representing thousandths. Therefore, I need to find the 3rd tick after 0.09, indicating it\u2019s still in the section of 0.09 but just slightly past it.
