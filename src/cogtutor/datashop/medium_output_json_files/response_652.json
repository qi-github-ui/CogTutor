The task involves locating specific numbers on a number line from 0.0 to 1.0.

To find 0.6, I would first identify 0.5 and then move one-tenth to the right. \\n\\nFor the second task regarding 0.03, I considered it is located near 0.0. I estimated it would be slightly to the right of 0.0, which requires less than half a mark to reach. \\n\\nIn the final task of comparing 0.08 and 0.018, I recalled that the larger number on the number line would be further to the right, so I concluded that 0.08 is larger than 0.018.
