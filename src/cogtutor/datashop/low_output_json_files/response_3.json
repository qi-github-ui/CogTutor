Now, you need to solve a math problem. Please describe your thought process and steps in detail according to your ability level. The math problem is: Problem Background\\nIn this activity, a number line will be displayed on the screen, and students need to determine the position of a specific value by estimating and comparing numbers.\\n\\nProblem Details\\nTask 1: Find the position of 0.097\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nThink about which number 0.097 is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\nIf this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.097 is closer to: 0, 0.1, or the middle at 0.05?\\nNote that this number is very close to 0.1. Therefore, once you estimate the position of 0.1, it's already a good estimate! Then move slightly to the left to reach the position of 0.097.\\nLet's try estimating the position of 0.097 by first finding 0.1! Start from the left end of the number line at 0.0. 0.1 should be one-tenth of a mark to the right of 0.0. Do you know if 0.097 is to the left or right of 0.1? Should you move left or right?\\nTask 2: Find the position of 0.9\\n\\nHints\\n\\nThe number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0.\\nLook at the number 0.9 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters!\\n0.9 is very close to 1, which is the right end of the number line.\\nHow would you estimate the position of 0.9 starting from 1? Should you move left or right? How much should you move?\\nTo find the position of 0.9, first reach the right end of the number line at 1, then move one-tenth of a mark to the left to reach the position of 0.9!\\nTask 3: Compare the sizes of 0.097 and 0.9\\n\\nProblem\\nNumber line range: From 0.0 to 1.0.\\nTask: On the number line, you have found the values 0.097 and 0.9.\\nQuestion: Which value is larger? Please fill in the correct answer.\\n\\nPlease fill in the larger value between 0.097 and 0.9: _______.\\n\\nHints\\n\\nWhich of the two numbers you placed on the number line is larger?\\nYou just need to remember whether the larger number is placed on the right or left, but the number line will give you hints; where is 0? Where is 1?\\nFeedback Mechanism\\nCorrect Operation: The screen will display a green \\\"Correct!\\\"\\nIncorrect Operation: The screen will display a red \\\"Incorrect, try another value.\\\"\\nAnswers:\\nTask 1 (Find the position of 0.097): The correct answer range is from 0.079 to 0.1.\\nTask 2 (Find the position of 0.9): The correct answer range is from 0.882 to 0.918.\\n\\nThis problem design aims to enhance students' understanding of the relative size of numbers through number line and number comparison activities, and to deepen their understanding of the relative size relationships between numbers through intuitive interaction..Ability level classification criteria:\\nLow-level students typically understand math problems slowly and need more time and help to solve them.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": \"To find the position of 0.097, I first look at the number line that goes from 0.0 to 1.0.
