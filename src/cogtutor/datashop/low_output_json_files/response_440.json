For 0.72, I think it's closer to 1 than to 0. I remember that 0.5 is the middle point, so I see that 0.72 is to the right of 0.5. I divide the number line into quarters: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. I can see 0.72 is just a bit less than 0.75. I decide to place it just a little left of 0.75.\\n\\nFor 0.084, I do the same. I see it's much closer to 0 than to 1.
