I believe 0.03 is definitely to the right of 0.0 since it's a positive number.\\n\\nNext, I need to check which tenth place 0.03 is closer to. Since 0.03 is less than 0.1, it must be closer to 0.0. I imagine moving a small distance from 0.0, and since 0.03 is quite small, I think I will move to the right less than half a mark to reach 0.03. This step-by-step approach helps me visualize where 0.03 is located, and I will mark it on the number line accordingly.\\n\\nFor the third task, I need to determine which of the two values, 0.08 or 0.018, is larger. I will rely on the number line again, remembering that the larger number will be positioned to the right. I see that 0.08 is greater than 0.018 based on where they are placed on the number line. Hence, I can confidently say that 0.08 is larger.

I counted each tiny mark, ensuring that I marked 0.03 between the small tick marks relative to 0.0. For 0.08, I visualized and counted 8 tiny marks after 0.0, which helped me see it more clearly between the tenths.
