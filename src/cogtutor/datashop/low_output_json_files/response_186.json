Since 0.03 is to the right of 0.0, I need to determine how far to the right I should move. Also, I can compare it with the nearest tenths, which are 0.0 and 0.1, to see how close 0.03 is to 0.05, the midpoint. It seems I need to move a very small distance to the right of 0.0 to reach 0.03. After visualizing it, I\u2019m ready to estimate the position.\\n\\nFor the third task, I need to determine which of the two values, 0.08 or 0.018, is larger. I can use the number line to see where these numbers are. I know that numbers on the right are larger, and I need to figure out which number is located further to the right on the number line.\\n\\nOverall, I feel prepared to tackle each part of this problem step by step!\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"While solving this problem, what assumptions or predictions are you making?

I'm deciding my next steps based on the hints provided. Those hints guide me on where to start from and help me understand how to move along the number line safely.
