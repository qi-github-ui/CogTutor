The hint suggests that I should also consider which tenth 0.03 is closer to. Since 0.03 is less than 0.1 and closer to 0.0, I know I am looking for a position near 0.0. I will visualize the number line and estimate that 0.03 is slightly to the right of 0.0. I'll move a small distance to the right from 0.0 to find the exact position.\\n\\nThe final task involves determining which value is larger between 0.08 and 0.018. I will again refer to the number line to see where these two numbers are placed. Since both values are between 0 and 1, I can see that 0.08 is further to the right than 0.018.
