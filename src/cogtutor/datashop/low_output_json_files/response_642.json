I should locate 0.0 first and then decide if I need to move left or right. It seems that 0.03 is to the right of 0.0 but close enough that I should only move less than half a mark to get to it. I think I can do that!\\n\\nNow moving to the third task, I need to compare the two values 0.08 and 0.018 on the number line. Since I have already found the positions of both numbers, I just need to remember that the number furthest to the right is the larger one. I can refer back to where I placed them to determine which is larger, which in this case should be 0.08 since it's located further to the right on the number line.\"\n\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": \"While solving this problem, what assumptions or predictions are you making?
