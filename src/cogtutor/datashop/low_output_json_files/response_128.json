Now, you need to solve a math problem. Please describe your thought process and steps in detail according to your ability level. The math problem is: Problem Background In this activity, a number line will be displayed on the screen, and students need to determine the position of a specific value by estimating and comparing numbers. Problem Details Task 1: Find the position of 0.72 Hints The number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0. Look at the number 0.72 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters! If this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.72 is closer to: 0.7, 0.8, or the middle at 0.75? Finding 0.7 is tricky, but do you know that the three-quarter position of the number line is 0.75? This is very close to 0.72! Imagine the number line is divided into four parts, then count three large, imaginary sections to the right from 0.0. Almost there! This number is hidden to the left of 0.75, which is three-quarters of the number line. Move less than half a mark to the left to reach 0.72. Task 2: Find the position of 0.084 Hints The number line extends from 0.0 to 1.0. Look at the number 0.084 and think about which position it is closer to: 0, 1, or the middle of the number line at 0.5? You can be creative, such as dividing the number line into quarters! If this is too difficult, you can also think about which tenth place 0.084 is closer to: 0, 0.1, or the middle at 0.05? Let's try estimating the position of 0.084 by first finding 0.1! Finding 0.1 is somewhat difficult, but do you know that one-tenth of the number line is 0.1? This is very close to 0.084! Imagine the number line is divided into ten parts, then count one large, imaginary section to the right from 0.0. Almost there! This number is hidden to the left of 0.1, which is one-tenth of the number line. Move less than a full mark to the left to reach 0.084. Task 3: Determine the larger number (operation corresponding to \\\"larger\\\") Problem Number line range: From 0.0 to 1.0. Task: On the number line, you have found the values 0.72 and 0.084. Question: Which value is larger? Please fill in the correct answer. Please fill in the larger value between 0.72 and 0.084: _______. Hints Which of the two numbers you placed on the number line is larger? You just need to remember whether the larger number is placed on the right or left, but the number line will give you hints; where is 0? Where is 1? Feedback Mechanism Correct Operation: The screen will display a green \\\"Correct!\\\" Incorrect Operation: The screen will display a red \\\"Incorrect, try another value.\\\" Answers: Task 1 (Find the position of 0.72): The correct answer range is from 0.702 to 0.738. Task 2 (Find the position of 0.084): The correct answer range is from 0.066 to 0.102. This problem design aims to enhance students' understanding of the relative size of numbers through number line and number comparison activities, and to deepen their understanding of the relative size relationships between numbers through intuitive interaction.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": \"To solve the problem, my first thought is to look at the number 0.72 on the number line.
