I know it goes from 0.0 to 1.0. The first task is to find the position of 0. I believe that 0 is the very starting point, so I understand that it should be at the very far left of the number line. For the second task, I need to find 0.05. Since 0.05 is greater than 0 but less than 0.1, I will look to the right of 0.0. I think it might be around one-fifth from 0, based on my understanding of tenths. For the third task, I need to determine which is larger, either 0 or 0.05. I remember that 0.05 is further along the number line, so it's larger.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"While solving this problem, what assumptions or predictions are you making?

I used the hints to refocus on how much distance 0.05 would be from 0.0 and made sure to click just a little over halfway to the right. After I positioned it correctly, I double-checked by comparing both values to ensure I had placed them accurately.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```"
