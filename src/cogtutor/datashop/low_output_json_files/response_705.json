For Task 1, I need to find where 0.349 is on the line. I know that 0.349 is closer to 0.3 than to 0.4. This helps me know that I should look around 0.3 for the answer. I might think of the line as being divided into quarters. The quarter marks are 0.25 and 0.5, so I imagine where 0.3 would be slightly to the right of the 0.25 mark. Then, I will estimate how far from 0.3 to get to 0.349.
